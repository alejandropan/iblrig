This function returns the current light measurement value of the Frame2TTL sensor. It is useful for validating the sensor, and for checking the brightness range of your ipad screen.

1. Identify the COM port of your Frame2TTL. On most IBL PCs, this is COM6. 
2. Copy this folder to C:\
3. Open an Anaconda prompt and navigate to C:\F2TTL
4. run the following:

python -c "import F2TTL; F2TTL.measureLight('COM6')"

This will take 250 light measurements and return the average to the terminal.
Units are in microseconds, and lower numbers indicate brighter light.

5. Use the white (rgb=255,255,255) and black (rgb=0,0,0) images in this folder to change the pixels under the sensor. You should see:

White: ~8-12
Black: ~500-50,000

For Frame2TTL to output TTL pulses indicating new frames, 
white must be <40 and black must be >80.
